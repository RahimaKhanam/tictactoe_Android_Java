# tictactoe_Android_Java

It is believed that the best way to learn programming is by getting your hands dirty and writing actual code rather than just relying on books. And since I am learning **Android Development**, I decided to start my journey by making small programs as it will give me a sense of accomplishment as it will be something that I have made by understanding every single line of the code. 


So, I started off the journey by making the app- Tic Tac Toe. It is a really nice project to practice coding in a fun and enjoyable way. That’s because the logic behind it is simple enough that even though it’s challenging at first, but I think everyone can make it.
